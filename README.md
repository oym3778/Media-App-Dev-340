# Omar Morales-Saez: App Development Class Projects

This repository contains projects I developed as part of my App Development coursework.  
The main focus is **Tali Fitness**, a functional workout tracking app, followed by class exercises demonstrating UI recreation and Flutter skills.

## ðŸš€ Featured Project: Tali Fitness

**Overview:**  
Tali Fitness is a mobile app that allows users to log and manage workouts throughout the week. In this final version, I integrated **Firebase Authentication and Firestore** to manage user data securely and provide real-time updates.

**Key Features:**
- User login and signup via Firebase Authentication
- User routines saved in Firestore
- Add/remove exercises for specific days
- Day-specific exercise display
- Clean, minimal UI for clarity

## ðŸŽ¨ Class Projects: Flutter Design-to-Spec

**Overview:**  
These two projects, **flutter_design_to_spec** and **flutter_design_to_spec_assets**, were completed to recreate a professor-provided app using supplied assets. They demonstrate my ability to follow design specifications precisely while applying class-learned skills.

**Tech Stack:** Flutter, Dart

**Structure:**  
- `flutter_design_to_spec` â€“ Main app code  
- `flutter_design_to_spec_assets` â€“ Assets (images, fonts, icons)  

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- UI implementation from design specifications
- Flutter widget usage (Stateless & Stateful)
- Layouts, theming, and styling
- Handling interactions with dialogs, buttons, and scrollable content
